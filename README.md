# CppNotes
C++ Language Notes made with Emacs Org!

### Description
These are some notes created to help those wanting to learn C++ without
any prior experience in it. Experience in some other programming language
preferably a strongly typed one is advised though.

### Issues
If any mistakes or inaccuracies are found within the notes, feel free to
open an issue and I'll do what I can to address it and update the notes.

I've also made the source .org file available encase you want to do a bit of
editing yourself. If you haven't touched Emacs before, org-mode is a truly
wonderful and feature-full tool.
